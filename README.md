# Cloak and Dagger: Revamp
A fork of Cloak and Dagger 1.9.0, slimmed down to just stealth.

## Reasons
The latest rework completely ruins the aspect of video game stealth - you can't necessarily 
just sneak behind a mob anymore for them to not see you. The rework almost required you to be
in pitch dark while making sure you have zero stealth-reducing armor.

In my case, I needed a mod that would add a line-of-sight stealth system that wasn't too clunky
or overdone. I liked Cloak and Dagger 1.9.0, but some features needed refining and some features
needed to be removed.

## Why not Footwork?
Footwork has a major compatibility issue with Epic Fight's stunning system. Nobody has found the
cause yet.
